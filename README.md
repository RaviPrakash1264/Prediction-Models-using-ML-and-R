I have addressed three issues related to health, entertainment and
industrial sector. I am listing them along with the machine learning
models that I have used to solve them.<br/>
-Breast Cancer detection machine learning model using Logistic
Regression as well using data visualization techniques to visualize the
dataset which I am using while implementation.<br/>
-Movies reviews Sentiment analysis using BERT and to visualize the
data using proper visualization techniques.<br/>
-Build an ANN Regression model to predict the electrical energy
output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant and using data visualization
techniques to come up with a more accurate conclusion.
